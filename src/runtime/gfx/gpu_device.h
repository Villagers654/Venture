// The process-wide host GPU device shared by every graphics path.
//
// Venture uses Vulkan as its only host graphics API (Windows and Linux, any
// vendor). One VkInstance/VkPhysicalDevice/VkDevice and one graphics queue are
// shared by:
//   * guest GLES/EGL, implemented by ANGLE's Vulkan backend running on this
//     device (ANGLE is patched so its instance/device creation goes through
//     Venture callbacks),
//   * guest Vulkan (forwarded to this device's instance/physical device; the
//     guest's own VkDevice is created on the same physical device),
//   * the host OpenXR session (XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2), which is why the device
//     is created through xrCreateVulkanInstanceKHR / xrCreateVulkanDeviceKHR
//     using the physical device chosen by xrGetVulkanGraphicsDevice2KHR.
// When no XR runtime is available (flat/debug mode) the device is created
// directly with the Vulkan loader.
